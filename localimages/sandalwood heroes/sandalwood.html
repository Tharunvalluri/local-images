    <p>Sudeep began his film career in Thayavva (1997). He then played a supporting role in Prathyartha, directed by Sunil Kumar Desai, and a lead role in the same director's Sparsha. In 2001, a role in Huchcha gave him his first big following. In 2008 he made his Bollywood debut in Phoonk.[7] He has also starred in Ram Gopal Varma's movies Rann, Phoonk 2 and Rakta Charitra.

        Starting from Veera Parampare (2010), he changed his stage name from Sudeep to Sudeepa per S. Narayan's advice and after the film's success he decided to keep the name.[8] His subsequent films, Kempe Gowda and Vishnuvardhana (2011), also were successes.
        
        Sudeepa made his debut in Telugu cinema in 2012, with S. S. Rajamouli's Eega, a fantasy film in which he portrayed an industrialist who, on falling for an NGO worker (played by Samantha Ruth Prabhu), kills her alleged lover, who begins to haunt him in the form of a housefly. The film and Sudeepa's performance were highly acclaimed.[9]
        
        In 2013, Bachchan and Varadanayaka were released. His next film was a drama titled Maanikya that he also directed, a remake of the Telugu film, Mirchi (2013) which was a huge hit. In 2015 he starred in Ranna, a remake of the Telugu film, Attarintiki Daredi,[10] which again was a blockbuster and played a cameo role as a Persian arms trader in Baahubali: The Beginning, directed by S. S. Rajamouli—the year's highest-grossing film.[11]
        
        He frequently sings in his screen roles, including Vaalee (2001), Chandu (2002), Ranga SSLC (2004), Nalla (2004), #73, Shaanthi Nivaasa (2007), Veera Madakari (2009), Kempe Gowda (2011), Bachchan (2013)[12] and also for others movies such as Mandya to Mumbai (2014), Ring Road Shubha (2014) and Raate (2015).
        
        In 2019, Sudeepa was seen in the Hindi film Dabangg 3 where he played the archenemy of Salman Khan's Chulbul Pandey.[13] He also plays Avuku Raju in Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy.
        
        Sudeepa completed his 26 years in film industry.[14]
        
        Sudeepa's next Vikrant Rona, directed by Anup Bhandari, featured Nirup Bhandari and Neetha Ashok.[15] He is also set to play an extended cameo as Bhargav Bakshi in the upcoming Pan India movie Kabzaa starring Upendra.

        <p>Director V. Somashekar cast Puneeth (then known as Lohith) onscreen when he was six months old in his thriller film Premada Kanike (1976).[16][17] This was followed by Vijay's Sanaadi Appanna (1977), based on Krishnamoorthy Puranik's novel of the same name,[18] when Puneeth was one year old. Thayige Thakka Maga (1978) was again directed by V. Somashekar and starred his father. Two years later, directors Dorai–Bhagavan cast him as Shyam in Vasantha Geetha (1980). This was followed by K. S. L. Swamy's mythological drama Bhoomige Banda Bhagavantha (1981, appearing as Lord Krishna) and B. S. Ranga's Bhagyavantha (1982),[19] in which he recorded his first popular song: "Baana Daariyalli Soorya", composed by T. G. Lingappa. That year, he appeared in two hit films (Chalisuva Modagalu and Hosa Belaku) with his father. For the former, Puneeth received his first Karnataka State Film Award for Best Child Actor (Male). In 1983, he appeared in two mythological films: Bhakta Prahlada as the protagonist, Prahlada, and Eradu Nakshatragalu, for which he received his second Karnataka State Film Award for Best Child Actor.[20]

            In 1984, Puneeth starred with Rajkumar in the thriller Yarivanu and sang "Kannige Kaanuva", written by Rajan–Nagendra. His biggest break as a child actor came in the 1985 drama Bettada Hoovu, directed by N. Lakshminarayan and based on Shirley L. Arora's novel What Then, Raman? For his portrayal of the innocent Ramu, Puneeth received the award for Best Child Artist at the 33rd National Film Awards.[21] In his early teens, he appeared in Shiva Mecchida Kannappa (1988) as the young Kannappa with his elder brother, Shiva. Puneeth's final child role was in Parashuram (1989), with his father.[22]
            
            In 1994, Puneeth began working as a manager in his family's production house. His first film as a manager was Geluvina Saradara (1996) starring Raghavendra.[23]</p>

        <p>Shiva Rajkumar started his acting career with the film Anand in 1986 [8] Before that, he had appeared as a child artist in a small role in the 1974 movie Sri Srinivasa Kalyana.[13][14] In his career spanning over 36 years, he played a variety of roles. The most notable movies of his career are Janumada Jodi, Jogi, Anand, Ratha Sapthami, Nammoora Mandara Hoove, Om and Chigurida Kanasu.[8] He acted in Sugreeva, which was shot in 18 hours. His Om, directed by Upendra, set a trend for gangster movies in Kannada and other film industries in India. It continues to be shown even to this day.[15]

            In Bhoomi Thayiya Chochchala Maga (1998), Shiva Rajkumar played Karna, a friend of legislator Bharath Kumar, played by Ramesh Aravind, out on a mission to achieve the latter's unfulfilled goal of having a dam constructed in a village. His performance received praise; Srikanth Srinivasa of Deccan Herald called it his "best... till date".[16] Srinivasa also praised Shiva Rajkumar for his performance in Don (2003), where he played a lawyer-turned-serial-killer, and wrote, "Shivanna excels in his role as the don. He has put in a spirited yet collected and controlled performance."[17]
            
            His film Cheluveye Ninne Nodalu was shot at the seven wonders of the world.[18] His 100th movie, Jogayya, is the sequel to his blockbuster Jogi.[19]</p>
