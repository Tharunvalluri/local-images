Barjatya's romantic family drama Maine Pyar Kiya (1989), which became one of the highest-grossing Indian films at the time.[39][40] It earned him his first nomination for the Best Actor at Filmfare. Maine Pyar Kiya was dubbed in English as When Love Calls, in Spanish as Te Amo, and in Telugu as Prema Paavuraalu.[41][42][43]

        In 1990 one film released starring Khan Baaghi, a box office success,[44] followed by three box office failures in 1991, Patthar Ke Phool, Love and Kurbaan. The same year, Khan went on to co-star with Sanjay Dutt and Madhuri Dixit for the romantic drama Saajan.[45]
        
        In 1992, he appeared in Suryavanshi, Jaagruti, Nishchaiy and Ek Ladka Ek Ladki. The year was not a successful year for him as all four films failed at the box office.[46]
        
        In 1994, Khan appeared in Rajkumar Santoshi's Andaz Apna Apna, co-starring Aamir Khan. At the time of its release, the film failed at the box office but has gained a cult status over the years.[47] Later in the year he collaborated with director Sooraj Barjatya in the romance Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! co-starring Madhuri Dixit. During the 1995 awards season, the film won 3 Filmfare Awards for Best Film, Best Director and Best Actress. It also won the National Award for being the most popular film of the year.[48] Earning more than ₹2 billion[49][50][51] ($63.8 million) worldwide, the film became the biggest Bollywood hit of the year and the highest-grossing Indian film up until then.[52] It is one of the films on Box Office India's list of "Biggest Blockbusters Ever in Hindi Cinema".[53] In 2006, it was still the fourth-highest grossing Bollywood film ever, according to Box Office India.[54] In 1995 he starred in Rakesh Roshan's Karan Arjun alongside Shah Rukh Khan. The two played brothers who are reincarnated after being killed by family enemies. His role as Karan earned him a nomination for the 1995 Filmfare Best Actor Award.[55]
        
        In 1996, Khan performed in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's directional debut Khamoshi: The Musical.[56] He also appeared in and Raj Kanwar's action hit Jeet.[57] He had two releases in 1997: Judwaa and Auzaar. The former was a comedy directed by David Dhawan where he played a dual role of twins separated at birth.[58]
        
        Khan worked in five different films in 1998, his first release being the romantic comedy film Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya opposite Kajol, one of the biggest commercial successes of that year.[59] This was followed by the moderately successful drama Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai [60] where Khan played a young man who has to take a child who claims to be his son, under his custody. Khan's performance in the film earned favourable critical review.[61] He also had an extended cameo in Karan Johar's directorial debut, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, which earned him critical acclaim and his first Filmfare Award under the Best Supporting Actor category.[62]
        
        In 1999, Khan starred in three films: Hum Saath-Saath Hain, Biwi No.1,[63] and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam alongside Aishwarya Rai and Ajay Devgan, which earned him another Best Actor nomination at the Filmfare awards.[64] His performance in the film was reviewed favourably, with Sharmila Telikum of Rediff noting, "Salman is endearing. He does tend to ham in the dramatic scenes, but looks very comfortable doing comedy and those romantic scenes</p>

        <p>Roshan was originally scheduled to make his screen debut as a lead actor opposite Preity Zinta in a cancelled film – Shekhar Kapur's Tara Rum Pum Pum.[24] Instead, he starred in his father's romantic drama Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000) opposite another debutante, Ameesha Patel. Roshan played dual roles: Rohit, an aspiring singer brutally killed after witnessing a murder, and Raj, an NRI who falls in love with Patel's character.[25] To prepare, he trained with the actor Salman Khan to bulk up physically,[26] worked to improve his diction and took lessons in acting, singing, dancing, fencing and riding.[27] With global revenues of ₹800 million (US$9.6 million),[28] Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai became one of the highest-grossing Indian films of 2000.[29] His performance was acclaimed by critics;[21][30] Suggu Kanchana on Rediff.com wrote, "[Roshan] is good. The ease and style with which he dances, emotes, fights, makes one forget this is his debut film ... He seems to be the most promising among the recent lot of star sons we have been subjected to."[25] For the role, Roshan received Best Male Debut and Best Actor Awards at the annual Filmfare Awards, IIFA Awards, and Zee Cine Awards.[31] He became the first actor to win both Filmfare Best Debut and Best Actor awards the same year.[32] The film established Roshan as a prominent actor in Bollywood.[33] The actor found life hard after his overnight success, particularly the demands on his time.[34]

            In his second release, Khalid Mohammed's crime drama Fiza, Roshan played Amaan, an innocent Muslim boy who becomes a terrorist after the 1992–93 Bombay riots.[34] Roshan appeared in the film to expand his horizons as an actor.[35] Co-starring Karisma Kapoor and Jaya Bachchan, Fiza was moderately successful at the box office,[36] and Roshan's performance earned him a second nomination for Best Actor at the Filmfare ceremony.[37] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama praised him as the production's prime asset, commending his "body language, his diction, his expressions, [and] his overall persona."[38] Roshan next appeared in Vidhu Vinod Chopra's action drama Mission Kashmir (2000) alongside Sanjay Dutt, Preity Zinta, and Jackie Shroff. Set in the valley of Kashmir during the Indo-Pakistani conflicts, the film addressed the topics of terrorism and crime, and was a financial success.[29] Roshan was drawn to his complex role of a young man traumatised by the discovery that his adoptive father had been responsible for the death of his entire birth family.[35] In Adarsh's opinion, Roshan "brightens up the screen with his magnetic presence. His body language, coupled with his expressions, is sure to win him plaudits."[39]</p>
